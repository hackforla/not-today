**Summary**

"NotToday: Self Defense Against Suicidal Thoughts" is a mobile application that empowers people with [chronic suicidal ideation](http://insurancethoughtleadership.com/understanding-person-with-suicidal-thoughts/) to withstand periods of acute suffering without acting on it. The app offers users the ability to view an “anti-suicide note" of their own text and image content, created by them during a time when they feel able to connect with their desire to live. Reminder notifications to view the note are then automatically sent daily, to ensure that a reminder will be received during periods when suicidal ideation is present.  

The daily notifications are the key difference between NotToday and currently available suicide safety plan apps. Existing products require that the user be able to care about themselves and their survival enough to open and use the app during a moment when they are feeling overwhelming self-hatred and desire to die. While such products are helpful to many, some individuals will not be able to muster these contradictory feelings. Individuals whose symptoms include [dissociation](https://www.verywellmind.com/dissociation-2797292) may not even be able to recall they downloaded the app at all.

NotToday's pre-set reminders, that check in with the user automatically regardless of mental state, ensure that the absence of the emotional or cognitive resources to open and engage with the app is not a limiting factor to its use.

**Background**

Suicidal ideation is unfortunately widespread: 4.3% of adults age 18 and older in the United States experienced it in 2017. Among adults aged 18-25, the prevalence was 10.5%. [[NIMH](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/suicide.shtml)] The range of suicidal ideation varies from fleeting thoughts or passive wishful thinking, to detailed plans. Most people who experience suicidal ideation do not go on to make suicide attempts, but it is a significant risk factor. [[American Family Physician](https://www.aafp.org/afp/1999/0315/p1500.html)]

Rather than being confined to a specific period of stressful life events or major depression, suicidal ideation can be a lifelong, chronic symptom often stemming from trauma. In such cases, suicidal ideation generally occurs during a state of dissociation: a mental process that causes a lack of connection in a person’s thoughts, memory and sense of identity.

This means that there is difficulty attaining a sense of continuity between suicidal and normal mental states. In the normal state, it is hard to conceptualize what it felt like to be in the suicidal one. Conversely, when in the suicidal state, it can be impossible to imagine it will ever change. This cycle can repeat over and over during the course of a lifetime, without the ability to retain the knowledge that the suicidal state always passes. Without that knowledge, each new suicidal state is experienced as completely real and endless, and is in danger of being acted upon.

**Features**

NotToday helps a sufferer of chronic suicidal ideation leave a “note” containing text and pictures chosen in their normal mental state to be viewed while in their suicidal one, as a reminder that their true self doesn’t actually want to die no matter how real the desires may feel at the time. The key features of the app are: 

* *User-controlled content*: It is vitally important that each user is able to populate the app with the content that is meaningful to them. Existing suicide safety plan apps often include suggestions that in some cases can be harmful. For example, recommendations to think of “how the people who love you would be affected,” can be severely painful to someone who is socially isolated or is being abused. Giving the user full control over app content averts this problem. Additionally, all content is stored locally; it is fully private and never uploaded to the cloud.
* *Daily reminders*: When in a dissociated suicidal state, a sufferer is not capable of recalling that they need to go back and look at the app. It is likely they will not even recall they have the app. This can be solved for by having the app remind the user each day to check in if they are having suicidal thoughts. The daily reminder acts as a source of orientation and continuity for the user’s mental health and survival goals.
* *Resources in case of suicidal crisis*: In the event that the ideation escalates to a crisis level, the app will include the standard questions to help the user determine if they are at imminent risk, and if so, 911 can be dialed or a crisis line texted from within the app.
* *Perspective and empathy*: As a peer-designed app, NotToday does not come from an institutional or medicalized perspective. This allows for better emotional validation of the user’s experience, and avoids the common pitfalls of being patronizing in tone, or making suggestions that can come off as clueless. Additionally, NotToday’s user interface is carefully designed to avoid any hint of visual clutter or friction in the onboarding experience, which may overwhelm someone suffering from lack of vitality who is in danger of giving up easily if the UX is frustrating.

Additional features in the future product roadmap:
* *Tracking/reporting*: Knowledge of metrics such as number of days of suicidal ideation per month are useful for patients and mental health professionals to determine the correct level of care, and to monitor if treatments are effective.
* *Journaling*: Expressive writing is well-supported by research as beneficial in a number of mental health conditions, including Major Depressive Disorder. [[Journal of Affective Disorders](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032713004448?via%3Dihub)] There are numerous journaling apps currently available for users; however, the mental health benefits of journaling may not be known to the individual user, and/or the motivation and energy to sort through the various offerings may not be present. A lightweight journaling feature added to NotToday would provide an easy platform for benefitting from expressive writing and, for the dissociative user, would help to maintain continuity of the practice by linking it with the daily reminder.
