*Not Today: Self-Defense Against Suicidal Thoughts* is an app in development by volunteers with [Hack for LA](http://hackforla.org), a brigade of [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org). It is a tool intended to help people wait out periods of suicidal thinking without acting on those thoughts. 

Many people are not aware that suicidality falls along a continuum ranging from suicide attempts, all the way to passive thoughts such as “I wouldn’t mind if I didn’t wake up in the morning.” It is common to have some form of suicidal thoughts at some point in life. 

However, for some people suicidal thoughts are a recurring problem that has to be endured over the course of years. We are hoping to create an app that can provide support to those who regularly undergo periods of suicidal thinking.

NOTE: *Not Today* is not intended for people in a suicidal crisis. If you need additional support outside your current resources, please reach out to the National Suicide Hotline at 1-800-273-8255 or [click here](https://tinyurl.com/yxlzd4qn) to see an international list.

If you would like to participate in a user survey or beta test when available, or learn more about further development, please check back soon to join our mailing list.
