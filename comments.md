Add links to how to find a psychotherapist

## Kathleen Gibson
*certified in mental health first aid and psychological first aid, have experience in the social services/mental health crisis, and also a suicide loss survivor*

**intro text screen**
I would start this off with something along the lines of, "If you're thinking about suicide, please call 911, 1-800-273-TALK, or text Crisis Text Line (with tappable links to all). 
Then I would go into what the app is about and its purpose. 
I would also have a "Text" button and/or button to call hotline on every page of the app. 

**2nd intro text screen**
I recommend including something on the normalcy of it, with an empathetic tone. And something like "thoughts of suicide are common and do not have to be acted on."
*statistics are in context.md*

*3rd intro text screen*
I would reword this so that the word ""normal" isn't used. 
*yes, that was a 1st draft placeholder*
