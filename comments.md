>I think safety plans have a purpose and use. I have an app on my phone that I've never used besides to make the initial plan, but it's good for me to have truly thought about why that's not the path I want to take with my life at this point because of _____ reason. My therapist never formally made one with me, although he did mention it occasionally. Signing a physical contract is not cool though, I'd bolt.

>I recently discussed this with my therapist. I have a death wish, have had it since I was 11 (or maybe even before, I don't know). It's been 24 years and I'm still here, no actual suicide attempt, not even any concrete plans made. So I feel pretty confident that I am not in danger despite engaging in SI. I explained to my therapist how knowing that death is there for me should I choose it brings me comfort and safety. How just the knowledge that should I choose it, everything can be over at any time, makes it easier to stick it out. I just keep reminding myself that it's okay if I ever do actually choose to kill myself and that this is an option I have. Even if I don't commit suicide, in the end I WILL die. I will not live in this world, in this body, in this life, with these memories and feelings forever. And this is incredibly liberating for me.

>Paradoxically, embracing the idea of causing my own death makes me much less likely to actually do so. It doesn't have to be a spur-of-the moment thing. I can wait a day. Or a week. Or two years. The option will still be there, like a trusted old friend and companion. I don't have to do it now. Even if at the moment I feel like crap, I can still stay here for a bit and just enjoy another cup of coffee. Or watch another episode of my favourite show. Or see how the next week will pan out. By wholly accepting my wish to die and that it is a valid option, I find myself not actively thinking about it much. It's just always there, like a low, almost pleasant hum. Like a promise. I wouldn't give it up for the world and it doesn't cause me any regrets or pain. Instead, it's incredibly freeing.

>So all this probably sounds crazy to a lot of people. But it's how I've stayed alive and moreover how I've been able to enjoy life. My therapist, luckily, understands and thinks it's a useful mechanism. She did say though that many therapists are uncomfortable with their client having a death wish and that many of them would consider this to be a problem to try and fix.

*certified in mental health first aid and psychological first aid, have experience in the social services/mental health crisis, and also a suicide loss survivor*

**intro text screen**
I would start this off with something along the lines of, "If you're thinking about suicide, please call 911, 1-800-273-TALK, or text Crisis Text Line (with tappable links to all). 
Then I would go into what the app is about and its purpose. 
I would also have a "Text" button and/or button to call hotline on every page of the app. 

**2nd intro text screen**
I recommend including something on the normalcy of it, with an empathetic tone. And something like "thoughts of suicide are common and do not have to be acted on."
*statistics are in context.md*

**3rd intro text screen**
I would reword this so that the word ""normal" isn't used. 
*for sure, that was a 1st draft placeholder*
