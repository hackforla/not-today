# "Anecdata"

[reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/d60y9l/what_do_you_think_of_a_nosuicide_contract_with/f0q4mom/)

I think safety plans have a purpose and use. I have an app on my phone that I've never used besides to make the initial plan, but it's good for me to have truly thought about why that's not the path I want to take with my life at this point because of _____ reason. My therapist never formally made one with me, although he did mention it occasionally. Signing a physical contract is not cool though, I'd bolt.

*certified in mental health first aid and psychological first aid, have experience in the social services/mental health crisis, and also a suicide loss survivor*

**intro text screen**
I would start this off with something along the lines of, "If you're thinking about suicide, please call 911, 1-800-273-TALK, or text Crisis Text Line (with tappable links to all). 
Then I would go into what the app is about and its purpose. 
I would also have a "Text" button and/or button to call hotline on every page of the app. 

**2nd intro text screen**
I recommend including something on the normalcy of it, with an empathetic tone. And something like "thoughts of suicide are common and do not have to be acted on."
*statistics are in context.md*

**3rd intro text screen**
I would reword this so that the word ""normal" isn't used. 
*for sure, that was a 1st draft placeholder*
