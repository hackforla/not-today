## For MVP

Ability to pause notifications. This will keep people from turning them off in a good period never to return, if they get annoying.

I might start to tune out the letter if I read the same thing every day (or ignore it/ the pop ups). It would be good if the content that popped up varied (which would, of course, require the user to add more). It would also be cool if the user could opt to allow it to pull from their photos like Facebook & Google Photos do to show memories from that day. This could also be potentially triggering if it pulled up a pic someone didn't want to see, but if users had to enable that option, they would think about what pics they have first (ideally)

App helps you gather "evidence" of your will to live as you go along, by the notifications providing you the option to write in a repository you can later pull from for the "note" itself if desired - and if not, is readable as a mini-journal.

## For Future Roadmap

Ability to learn from user which content helps them more
