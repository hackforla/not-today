## DepressionEats
Sometimes when severely depressed, even microwaving something is not possible, let alone grocery shopping. I've learned to use meal replacement products during those times. However, leaving home to shop for them is often impossible, and even going on Amazon can require too much persistance through multiple steps. 
An app that is strictly for ordering meal replacements while depressed, like [Push for Pizza](https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/5/5970801/push-for-pizza-app-might-change-your-life), could solve for this by reducing the number of steps needed to acquire food to the absolute minimum. There would be a limited number of choices to prevent overwhelm/choice paralysis.
