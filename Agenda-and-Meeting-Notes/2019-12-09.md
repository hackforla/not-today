### Agenda
Privacy research

### ACTIONABLE:

### MEETING NOTES
In attendance:  Mya Stark, Nick Gieschen

Nick completed privacy research issue. Highlights:
* It is indeed possible to offer "No SI" "Dismiss with SI" "View Note" options on the notifications. This is for the tracker to be able to collect info on presence/absence of SI without user having to look at their note/open the app.
* Backup is best handled by offering the option to encrypt and connect to a cloud account from an outside vendor. This is also an opportunity to educate that the contents of the phone may be  getting uploaded regardless unless they have opted out elsewhere.
* We can offer notification muting by geolocation which is hella cool.
* NotToday can link to specific content in other apps such as a Spotify playlist.
* We can offer various app icons to help camoflauge the app on the desktop - in iOS. There is a way to do it in Android but will probably require action outside the app.
