### [Chronic suicidal thoughts and implicit memory: hypothesis and practical implications](https://github.com/hackforla/not-today/blob/master/lit-review/chronic%20suicidal%20ideation%20and%20implicit%20memory%20paper.pdf)

<sup>[Dr. Nicholas Bendit](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicholas_Bendit), Centre for Psychotherapy, James Fletcher Hospital, Newcastle, NSW, Australia</sup>

>**Objective:** This paper outlines a hypothesis linking the development of implicit memory in infants and chronic suicidal thoughts in adults. In order to do this, the developmental trajectory of memory is reviewed, as well as how attachment experiences are encoded in implicit memory. The cognitive/ emotional capacity of infants is then compared to the subjective experience of the chronically suicidal patient. This is used to develop the hypothesis that chronic suicidal thoughts are located in implicit memory, encoded very early in life. This idea is then used to explain why common responses by mental health workers to the chronically suicidal patient may inadvertently reinforce suicidal thoughts. Finally, understanding these concepts helps us to understand how psychotherapy can change chronic suicidal ideation.

>**Conclusion:** A hypothesis is proposed to link infant memory systems with adult chronic suicidal thoughts, and is used to understand helpful responses for patients who suffer with chronic suicidal ideation.

>Suicidal ideation is more common than completed suicide. Most persons who commit suicide have a psychiatric disorder at the time of death. Because many patients with psychiatric disorders are seen by family physicians and other primary care practitioners rather than by psychiatrists, it is important that these practitioners recognize the signs and symptoms of the psychiatric disorders (particularly alcohol abuse and major depression) that are associated with suicide. Although most patients with suicidal ideation do not ultimately commit suicide, the extent of suicidal ideation must be determined, including the presence of a suicide plan and the patient's means to commit suicide.

### [UNDER SEIGE ON THE EDGE OF THE BIG EMPTY: THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS](https://github.com/hackforla/not-today/blob/master/lit-review/Emptiness:Deadness.pdf)

<sup>Gary A. Taylor, Ph.D.</sup>

This rather dramatically named self-published excerpt from a larger book contains the best description I've read of the kind of dead feeling that characterizes a dissociated sucidial mental state, and presents the underlying biology well. Lots of interesting stuff about the role of the vagus nerve. Interested nerds may want to check out [polyvagal theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvagal_theory).

### [33 Habits of People Who Deal With Chronic Suicidal Thoughts](https://github.com/hackforla/not-today/blob/master/lit-review/Habits%20of%20People%20Who%20Deal%20With%20Chronic%20Suicidal%20Thoughts%20_%20The%20Mighty.pdf)

>When you live with suicidal thoughts, the monologue inside your head might sound like this: “I just want the pain to stop.” “People will be better off without you.” “You shouldn’t exist anymore.” When you’re living with chronic suicidal thoughts, that monologue rarely stops. This persistence can make it exhausting and painful to get through one day, one hour or even just one moment. And in those moments, sometimes we need little reminders or coping strategies to help us keep going. That is why we asked people in our Mighty mental health community who live with suicidal thoughts to share a “habit” they’ve developed that’s helped them keep living. While it can be hard to make those thoughts completely disappear, learning to manage them is so important — because you’re important, and in case no one’s told you this today: we’re so glad you’re here. Here is what our community told us.
