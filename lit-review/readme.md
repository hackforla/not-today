### [Chronic suicidal thoughts and implicit memory: hypothesis and practical implications](https://github.com/hackforla/not-today/blob/master/lit-review/chronic%20suicidal%20ideation%20and%20implicit%20memory%20paper.pdf)<br>
<sup>[Dr. Nicholas Bendit](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicholas_Bendit),`NotToday academic advisor`, Centre for Psychotherapy, James Fletcher Hospital, Newcastle, NSW, Australia</sup> 

>**Objective:** This paper outlines a hypothesis linking the development of implicit memory in infants and chronic suicidal thoughts in adults. In order to do this, the developmental trajectory of memory is reviewed, as well as how attachment experiences are encoded in implicit memory. The cognitive/ emotional capacity of infants is then compared to the subjective experience of the chronically suicidal patient. This is used to develop the hypothesis that chronic suicidal thoughts are located in implicit memory, encoded very early in life. This idea is then used to explain why common responses by mental health workers to the chronically suicidal patient may inadvertently reinforce suicidal thoughts. Finally, understanding these concepts helps us to understand how psychotherapy can change chronic suicidal ideation.

>**Conclusion:** A hypothesis is proposed to link infant memory systems with adult chronic suicidal thoughts, and is used to understand helpful responses for patients who suffer with chronic suicidal ideation.

>Suicidal ideation is more common than completed suicide. Most persons who commit suicide have a psychiatric disorder at the time of death. Because many patients with psychiatric disorders are seen by family physicians and other primary care practitioners rather than by psychiatrists, it is important that these practitioners recognize the signs and symptoms of the psychiatric disorders (particularly alcohol abuse and major depression) that are associated with suicide. Although most patients with suicidal ideation do not ultimately commit suicide, the extent of suicidal ideation must be determined, including the presence of a suicide plan and the patient's means to commit suicide.

<sup>Gary A. Taylor, Ph.D.</sup>

This rather dramatically named self-published excerpt from a larger book contains the best description I've read of the kind of dead feeling that characterizes a dissociated sucidial mental state, and presents the underlying biology well. Lots of interesting stuff about the role of the vagus nerve. Interested nerds may want to check out [polyvagal theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvagal_theory).

>**Abstract:** Psychoanalysis and the decentered self, normal multiplicity of self, and dissociation as an interpersonal process, are some of the topics covered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

### [33 Habits of People Who Deal With Chronic Suicidal Thoughts](https://github.com/hackforla/not-today/blob/master/lit-review/Habits%20of%20People%20Who%20Deal%20With%20Chronic%20Suicidal%20Thoughts%20_%20The%20Mighty.pdf)<br>
<sup>User Community, [The Mighty](https://themighty.com/) (Medium-like blogging platform for people with mental health issues)</sup>

>When you live with suicidal thoughts, the monologue inside your head might sound like this: “I just want the pain to stop.” “People will be better off without you.” “You shouldn’t exist anymore.” When you’re living with chronic suicidal thoughts, that monologue rarely stops. This persistence can make it exhausting and painful to get through one day, one hour or even just one moment. And in those moments, sometimes we need little reminders or coping strategies to help us keep going. That is why we asked people in our Mighty mental health community who live with suicidal thoughts to share a “habit” they’ve developed that’s helped them keep living. While it can be hard to make those thoughts completely disappear, learning to manage them is so important — because you’re important, and in case no one’s told you this today: we’re so glad you’re here. Here is what our community told us.

>Some people who think of suicide do not want to stop. They say it comforts them to know they can die by suicide if ever the pain of life gets to be too much for them. This dynamic led some experts to refer to “suicide fantasy as life-sustaining recourse.”

### [The Three-Step Theory: A New Theory of Suicide Rooted in the "Ideation-to-Action" Framework](https://github.com/hackforla/not-today/blob/master/lit-review/The%20Three-Step%20Theory.pdf)
<sub>[E. David Klonsky](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/david-klonsky/), `NotToday adcademic advisor`, and Alexis M. May, Department of Psychology, University of British Columbia

>Klonsky and May (2014) argued that an “ideation-to-action” framework should guide suicide theory, research, and prevention. From this perspective, (a) the development of suicide ideation and (b) the progression from ideation to suicide attempts are distinct processes with distinct explanations. The present article introduces a specific theory of suicide rooted in the ideation-to-action framework: the Three-Step Theory (3ST).

### [Cross-National Prevalence and Risk Factors for Suicidal Ideation, Plans, and Attempts](https://github.com/hackforla/not-today/blob/master/lit-review/Cross%20National%20SI.pdf)
<sub>Matthew K. Nock, PhD, Guilherme Borges, PhD, et al
  
The cross-national lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts is 9.2%, 3.1%, and 2.7%. Across all countries, 60% of transitions from ideation to plan and attempt occur within the first year after ideation onset. Consistent cross-national risk factors included being: female, younger, less educated, unmarried, and having a mental disorder. Interestingly, the strongest diagnostic risk factors were mood disorders in developed countries but impulse-control disorders in developing countries....Among suicide ideators, the conditional probability of ever making a suicide plan is 33.6% and of ever making a suicide attempt is 29.0%. The probability of attempt among ideators with a plan is 56.0% but only 15.4% among those without a plan.

Post traumatic stress disorder is often associated with an increase in suicidal thoughts and behaviors. However, this link remains poorly understood; particularly unclear are the mechanisms victims use to help them persevere through periods of increased suicidal ideation. This pilot study of veterans examines the frequency and quantity of suicidal ideation as well as preventative cognitions the victim utilizes to prevent suicide. These cognitions are known as counter-suicidal cognitions.

#### Further reading: [Half in Love With Death: Managing the Chronically Suicidal Patient](https://www.amazon.com/Half-Love-Death-Managing-Chronically-ebook/dp/B075WRGG5P) (book)
<sub>Joel Paris, MD

Half in Love With Death presents a new way for therapists to manage chronically suicidal patients, an incredibly challenging task for clinicians and one where an insufficient amount of literature exists to guide professionals. Author Joel Paris suggests an approach that defies conventional wisdoms about whether suicide can be predicted or prevented. He asserts that managing chronically suicidal patients begins with tolerating suicidality, understanding the inner world of patients, avoiding repeated hospitalizations, and focusing on life situations that maintain suicidal ideas and behaviors.

## Index/Descriptions - Mental Health App Design

[Young People's Response to Six Smartphone Apps for Anxiety and Depression: Focus Group Study](https://github.com/hackforla/not-today/blob/master/lit-review/young%20peoples%20response%20to%20MH%20apps.pdf)
<sub>Garrido, Cheers, et al.
  
On the whole, this study demonstrates that mental health apps need to cater to the individuality of the users. Features to improve user experience and engagement include personalization by developing customizable content and user interfaces, as well as providing feedback and progress tracking for the individual, on an opt-in, opt-out basis. Overburdening users with a lot of reading and other content is not appealing to many young users, leading to a lack of engagement with many currently available apps. It is therefore crucial to develop concrete and action-oriented features with a fun and entertaining design to motivate millennials to learn about mental health.
