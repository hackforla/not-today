## Chronic suicidal thoughts and implicit memory: hypothesis and practical implications

**Objective:** This paper outlines a hypothesis linking the development of implicit memory in infants and chronic suicidal thoughts in adults. In order to do this, the developmental trajectory of memory is reviewed, as well as how attachment experiences are encoded in implicit memory. The cognitive/ emotional capacity of infants is then compared to the subjective experience of the chronically suicidal patient. This is used to develop the hypothesis that chronic suicidal thoughts are located in implicit memory, encoded very early in life. This idea is then used to explain why common responses by mental health workers to the chronically suicidal patient may inadvertently reinforce suicidal thoughts. Finally, understanding these concepts helps us to understand how psychotherapy can change chronic suicidal ideation.

**Conclusion:** A hypothesis is proposed to link infant memory systems with adult chronic suicidal thoughts, and is used to understand helpful responses for patients who suffer with chronic suicidal ideation.

## Evaluation and Treatment of Patients with Suicidal Ideation

Suicidal ideation is more common than completed suicide. Most persons who commit suicide have a psychiatric disorder at the time of death. Because many patients with psychiatric disorders are seen by family physicians and other primary care practitioners rather than by psychiatrists, it is important that these practitioners recognize the signs and symptoms of the psychiatric disorders (particularly alcohol abuse and major depression) that are associated with suicide. Although most patients with suicidal ideation do not ultimately commit suicide, the extent of suicidal ideation must be determined, including the presence of a suicide plan and the patient's means to commit suicide.
