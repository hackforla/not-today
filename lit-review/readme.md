**Objective:** This paper outlines a hypothesis linking the development of implicit memory in infants and chronic suicidal thoughts in adults. In order to do this, the developmental trajectory of memory is reviewed, as well as how attachment experiences are encoded in implicit memory. The cognitive/ emotional capacity of infants is then compared to the subjective experience of the chronically suicidal patient. This is used to develop the hypothesis that chronic suicidal thoughts are located in implicit memory, encoded very early in life. This idea is then used to explain why common responses by mental health workers to the chronically suicidal patient may inadvertently reinforce suicidal thoughts. Finally, understanding these concepts helps us to understand how psychotherapy can change chronic suicidal ideation.

**Conclusion:** A hypothesis is proposed to link infant memory systems with adult chronic suicidal thoughts, and is used to understand helpful responses for patients who suffer with chronic suicidal ideation.

Suicidal ideation is more common than completed suicide. Most persons who commit suicide have a psychiatric disorder at the time of death. Because many patients with psychiatric disorders are seen by family physicians and other primary care practitioners rather than by psychiatrists, it is important that these practitioners recognize the signs and symptoms of the psychiatric disorders (particularly alcohol abuse and major depression) that are associated with suicide. Although most patients with suicidal ideation do not ultimately commit suicide, the extent of suicidal ideation must be determined, including the presence of a suicide plan and the patient's means to commit suicide.


## UNDER SEIGE ON THE EDGE OF THE BIG EMPTY: THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS

### Gary A. Taylor, Ph.D.

This rather dramatically named self-published excerpt from a larger book contains the best description I've read of the kind of dead feeling that characterizes a dissociated sucidial mental state, and presents the underlying biology well. Lots of interesting stuff about the role of the vagus nerve. Interested nerds may want to check out [polyvagal theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvagal_theory).


## Standing in the Spaces: The Multiplicity of Self and the Psychoanalytic Relationship
[file location](https://github.com/hackforla/not-today/blob/master/lit-review/E1f_5%20Bromberg_P_Standing_in_the_Spaces.pdf)
### Philip Bromberg, Ph.D.
Contemporary Psychoanalysis, 1996

Abstract: 
Contends that psychoanalysis is at its core a highly specialized communicative field, and what constitutes a psychoanalytically meaningful moment is constantly in motion with regard to one's experience of both reality and temporality. The shifting quality of time and meaning reflects the enactment of self-states in both patient and analyst that define the multiplicity of relationships that go on between the patient's selves and the analyst's selves, only some of which are being focused on at any given moment. Human personality possesses the extraordinary capacity to negotiate continuity and change simultaneously, and will do so under the right relational conditions. This attribute is what analysts rely on to make clinical psychoanalysis, or any form of psychodynamic psychotherapy, possible. Psychoanalysis and the decentered self, normal multiplicity of self, and dissociation as an interpersonal process, are some of the topics covered.
